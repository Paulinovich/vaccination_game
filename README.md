# vaccination_game
Little vaccine themed game inspired by mine sweeper. 
<br><br>The user should try to live long enough to find the reward on the field. He or she should avoid catching an infection for which the vaccine is not yet collected. On every game tile, the user gets information about how many infections or preventions are on the neighboring tiles. Navigation goes with the arrow key. The decision if an infection will kill the unvaccined player or just lower his or her health is dependent on the real mortality rate of this disease. 
<br><br>This project is object oriented programmed with Java. The game will be run in a JavaFX application. 

## Project status

This project is still in progress and is missing some important functions. It can therefor not be run yet. 

## Contributing

This is one of my first projects and meant as a learning process. For that reason I would like to develop the different functionalities myself first and welcome feedback about my decisions and code.
